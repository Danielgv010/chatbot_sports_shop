This project provides a seamless way for users to interact with an Azure-powered conversational model through a user-friendly web interface. The chatbot is designed to assist customers by answering queries such as:  

> *"List me the best products for playing football."*  

In response, the bot provides a direct link to the relevant category, making it easy for users to explore products.  

### **Available Categories:**  
- 🚴 **Bike**
